#  Legal Case Classification API (LawPavilion NLP Challenge)

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to classify legal case reports into their respective **areas of law** (e.g., Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, Company Law, etc.).

It supports inference via a **FastAPI endpoint** where users can submit the full body of a legal judgment (`full_report`) and receive the predicted legal category.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess dataset
- Build a pipeline that maps legal case reports to legal categories.
- Compared traditional ML methods (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) vs transformer-based deep learning models (DeBERTa).
- Serve the final transformer model as an API.

---

##  Dataset Overview

- **`full_report`**: The body of the legal judgment.
- **`introduction`**: Used to extract the area of law (labels).
- Other fields: `case_title`, `suitno`, `facts`, `issues`, `decision`.

Labels include:
- Civil Procedure
- Criminal Law and Procedure
- Enforcement of Fundamental Rights
- Company Law
- Election Petition, etc.

##  Approach

### 1 Traditional ML Pipeline

- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF (`TfidfVectorizer`)
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Label Extraction**: Regex pattern matching from `introduction`
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy: ~35%
  - F1 Score: Low for imbalanced classes
- **Limitation**: Unable to understand contextual meaning, struggled with nuanced legal phrasing.

### 2 Transformer-based Pipeline

- **Model Used**: `distilbert-base-uncased` fine-tuned on `full_report`
- **Tokenizer**: Hugging Face tokenizer
- **Label Encoder**: `LabelEncoder()` for mapping categories
- **Training**: Done on CPU (adapted for low-resource environment)
- **Evaluation**:
  - Higher F1 and accuracy
  - Better understanding of complex language
  - Handled rare labels more gracefully
